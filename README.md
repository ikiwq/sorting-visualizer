# Sorting Visualizer
A simple tool built in Java to visualize sorting algorithms. The graphical interface is provided by swing.
#### Choose between Bubble and Insertion sort.
Choose the algorithm you want to visualize and click "Sort!" to see the algorithm in action.

## Supported algorithms
1. Bubble Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. It has a time complexity of O(n^2) and is primarily used for educational purposes or on small datasets due to its inefficiency.
2. Insertion Sort is a sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array one element at a time. It iterates through the input array, comparing each element to its predecessors and inserting it into the correct position. Insertion Sort has an average and worst-case time complexity of O(n^2), but it performs well on small or nearly sorted datasets.

## Requisites
